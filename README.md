# i-BSB Banking App

This is where it all started, my first application built without going through tutorial hell. The i-BSB Banking App is a simple  C# application, making use of ASP.Net's Windows Form Framework. I developed this as a capstone project at UCT, which deepened my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
#### IMPORTANT NOTE: 
This project is quite old and was not finished due to time constraints so there may be a few errors here and there. There is still major room for improvement, and the coding practices in this project are still very novice compared to my current standards.

## Features:
